## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Tom Greis, a communication designer from Hamburg. I design beautiful things, now also in code.**

- I'm currently working on improving my coding skills.
- I'm learning HTML, CSS, JS and everything else a good website needs.
- I have taught design, ask me when it comes to layout, typography, colors and UI/UX.
- I'm happy to help when things aren't written the way they should be.
